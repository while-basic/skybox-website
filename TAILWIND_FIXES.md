# Tailwind CSS Configuration Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **PostCSS Configuration**
   - Updated `postcss.config.mjs` to use the correct plugins format
   - Changed from `plugins: ["@tailwindcss/postcss"]` to the proper object format with `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer`

2. **CSS Imports**
   - Updated `globals.css` to use the correct Tailwind CSS directives
   - Changed from `@import "tailwindcss"` to `@import "tailwindcss/base"`, `@import "tailwindcss/components"`, and `@import "tailwindcss/utilities"`
   - Added `@layer components` to properly scope custom component styles

3. **Layout Adjustments**
   - Simplified the body class in `layout.tsx` to use our custom CSS variables
   - Removed hardcoded Tailwind classes that were causing conflicts

4. **Custom CSS Variables**
   - Maintained the CSS variables approach for theming
   - Ensured dark mode support through media queries

5. **Favicon Conflict Resolution**
   - Removed duplicate favicon.ico from src/app directory
   - Kept the favicon.ico in the public directory (standard location)

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Better Compatibility**: The configuration now works correctly with Tailwind CSS v3.4.17
2. **Simplified Styling**: Using CSS variables provides a consistent theming approach
3. **Proper Component Scoping**: Using `@layer components` ensures our custom styles work well with Tailwind's utility classes
4. **Improved Build Process**: The build now completes successfully without CSS-related errors
5. **Resolved Asset Conflicts**: Fixed the conflict between public and app directory assets

## Additional Improvements

1. **Deployment Script**: Added a simple `deploy.sh` script to automate the build and deployment process
2. **Updated Documentation**: Updated the README.md with accurate information about the technologies used
3. **Production Ready**: The website now builds and runs correctly in both development and production environments
